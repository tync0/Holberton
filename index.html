                    Currently, I am participating in 5 startup projects as a mobile developer. The most successful of these projects are: Healwith and Foodmania.
                    Healwith startup has achieved success by participating in a number of events and competitions. Foodmania is in the Incubation program of SABAH.HUB institution. After a short time, we aim to finish the application and enter the market.

                    I try to participate in hackathons and other competitions as much as I can. I have formed a group for hackathons.
                    We were awarded the 1st place in the last Mission:2030 hackathon we participated in.

                    I have a lot of interest in the IT field. Therefore, I want to get a chance to develop in this field and work in the most famous companies in the world.
                    In addition, if our startup projects are successful, we will have established our own business.
